## Project Idea

### Problem Statement

Collector edition vehicles, celebrated for their exclusivity and rarity, often present a perplexing challenge within the automotive market. These remarkable vehicles, produced in limited numbers, exude an air of mystique and allure. However, this exclusivity frequently results in a conspicuous lack of transparency and accessibility for potential buyers and collectors alike. The issue lies in the restricted dissemination of information about these vehicles' sale and details, which tends to be shared selectively with a privileged few, leaving many enthusiasts and prospective buyers in the dark. This exclusivity leads to several predicaments. Firstly, it results in a dearth of information, leaving potential buyers uninformed about critical details, such as the vehicle's history, specifications, or condition. Secondly, the transactions surrounding these exclusive vehicles often transpire in secrecy, obscuring vital details like sale prices and the parties involved. Thirdly, access to these vehicles is predominantly reserved for a select circle of individuals who possess pre-existing relationships with the manufacturers or sellers. This exclusivity invariably excludes newcomers, collectors from diverse backgrounds, and genuine enthusiasts lacking industry connections. Lastly, verifying the authenticity and provenance of collector edition vehicles poses a significant challenge, complicating the buyer's ability to ascertain the vehicle's history and modifications. 

### Solution

The "ExoVault" project aims to create a robust blockchain-based repository to store and preserve details of exotic motor vehicles, enabling new collectors to verify their authenticity.

### 3. Blockchain-Based Secure Data Storage for Distributed Vehicular Networks
#### Muhammad Umar Javed, Mubariz Rehman, Nadeem Javaid, Abdulaziz Aldegheishem, Nabil Alrajeh, Muhammad Tahir

The rapid advancements in vehicular networks (VNs) and the increasing amount of data generated by vehicles have led to the need for secure and efficient data storage solutions. Traditional centralized data storage systems are vulnerable to security breaches and single points of failure, making them unsuitable for VNs. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable nature, offers a promising alternative for secure data storage in VNs.
The proposed system utilizes a combination of blockchain technology and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address the challenges of secure data storage in VNs. Blockchain is employed to store data hashes and manage data access control, while IPFS provides a distributed file storage platform for storing the actual vehicle data.

Vehicle data is first encrypted and then stored in IPFS. The hash value of the encrypted data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity and immutability. Vehicles can request access to data by providing their identities and the corresponding data hash. The system verifies the identity of the requesting vehicle and grants access if authorized.

#### Trust Management
A trust management mechanism is implemented to assess the trustworthiness of vehicles based on their contributions to the network and their past behavior. Vehicles with higher trust values are given priority in data access and service provisioning.

#### Incentivization Mechanism
To motivate vehicles to participate in the network and provide accurate data, an incentivization mechanism is employed. Vehicles receive rewards in the form of cryptocurrency for contributing data and maintaining high trust values. These rewards can be used to purchase services or resources within the VN.

The proposed system has been evaluated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in terms of security, scalability, and performance. The system exhibits resilience against malicious attacks and can handle a large number of vehicles and data transactions efficiently.
